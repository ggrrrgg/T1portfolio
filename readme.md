# Description

## Purpose

    My website is designed to be an online showcase of my web development skills as well as an information resource for any prospective employers who wish to get a broad picture of my skilset, experience, and what I'm about.

## Functionality / Features

    The functionality / feautures of my site is pretty simple, it consists of 5 pages with some basic text information and graphic assistance, and a navigation bar. The nav section at the bottom right of the page is colour coded to the background colour of each page for a simple user experience. In addition, the smiley face logo in the top right of the header on each page returns you to the homepage.

## Target Audience

    The target audience at this stage is anyone who is interested in having a personalized website built for them. As my background is in music and creative arts thats where I'd be initially focusing on getting freelance or contract work. My aim is to build on the interactivity of the site with appropriate aesthetics as I grow my development knowledge and skills.
