# Description

## Purpose

    My website is designed to be an online showcase of my web development skills as well as an information resource for any prospective employers who wish to get a broad picture of my skillset, experience, and what I'm about.

## Functionality / Features

    The functionality / feautures of my site is pretty simple, it consists of 5 pages with a common layout and styling. Each page has a header and footer, some basic text information with graphical aids, and a navigation bar. 
    
    The navigation bar is at the bottom right of each page, each page link is colour coded to the background colour of its corresponding page for a more simple and intuitive user experience. 
    
    The header contains a smiley face logo in the top right which returns you to the homepage.
    
    The footer contains links to Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram in the form of icons that transition in colour when you hover over them.

    The Education page contains a list of coding languages that have colour transitioning bullet points and icons.

    The resume page has an object insertion of a pdf file.

    Each page is also responsive to display on mobile, tablet, and desktop screensizes.

## Target Audience

    The target audience at this stage is anyone who is interested in having a personalized website built for them. As my background is in music and creative arts thats where I'd be initially focusing on getting freelance or contract work. My aim is to build on the interactivity of the site with appropriate aesthetics as I grow my development knowledge and skills.
